# 📝 Bash Script: Commenting Basics

This script demonstrates how to use **comments** in Bash scripting. Comments are an essential part of writing clean and understandable scripts. They are ignored during execution but help explain what the code is doing.

## 📜 Script Overview (`commented_script.sh`)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This is a simple Bash script to demonstrate comments and basic commands

# Print a welcome message
echo "👋 Welcome! You are learning Bash scripting on DAREY.IO."

# Create a directory named TestFolder
mkdir TestFolder

# List all files and folders in the current directory
ls -la

# Display a goodbye message
echo "✅ Script execution complete. Goodbye!"
```
