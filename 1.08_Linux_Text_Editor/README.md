# 📝 Linux Text Editors

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **Vim** and **Nano**, two powerful terminal-based text editors in Linux, to create and modify files directly from the command line.

## 🧠 Working with Vim

Vim is a modal editor, meaning it operates in different modes (insert, normal, command, etc.).

### 🔧 Common Vim Commands Used:

- `vim exercise.txt` – Open or create a file named `exercise.txt`
- Press `i` – Enter **Insert Mode** to begin typing
- Press `Esc` – Exit **Insert Mode**
- Use arrow keys – Navigate within the file
- Type `:wq` – Save and quit the file
- Type `:q!` – Quit without saving changes

### 📸 Vim Screenshots:
